The DATA layer will keep all the external dependency-related code as to:
1. Repository: Repository implementations
2. DataSource: All data source interfaces and entities. An entity represents a single instance of your domain object saved into the database as a record. It has some attributes that we represent as columns in our DB tables or API endpoints. We canâ€™t control how data is modeled on the external data source, so these entities are required to be mapped from entities to domain models in the implementations
